## multi-threaded basic WEB server
###### server is limited in its functionality; it does not handle any HTTP requests other than GET, understands only a few content types, and supports only the QUERY_STRING environment variable for CGI programs.
###### The approach for a multi-threaded server was is to create a fixed-size pool of worker threads when the web server is first started. With the pool-of-threads approach, each thread is blocked until there is an http request for it to handle. Therefore, if there are more worker threads than active requests, then some of the threads will be blocked, waiting for new http requests to arrive, if there are more requests than worker threads, then those requests will need to be buffered until there is a ready thread.
###### In my implementation,I have a master thread that begins by creating a pool of worker threads, the number of which is specified on the command line. the master thread is responsible for accepting new http connections over the network and placing the descriptor in queue. The size of the queue is also specified on the command line.
